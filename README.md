Online store "Mono"
Developed an online store called Mono, specializing in the sale of clothing. I used HTML and CSS to create this project. The online store has separate buttons for registering and logging in. The navigation menu is located at the top of the page and includes several buttons: "About us" (providing information about our store), "Homepage" (going to the main page) and "Card" (providing information about payment methods and instructions for transferring money).
